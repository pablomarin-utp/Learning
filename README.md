# Learning Python and Artificial Intelligence 🧠🐍

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This is a **personal** learning repository — nothing here is professional, organized, or final. It's a messy space where I practice and experiment while I learn. You're welcome to explore, but don't expect polished code or perfect structure.

This repo is where I practice and learn the basics of **Python** and **Artificial Intelligence**. I'm uploading small projects, exercises, and experiments as I study and explore on my own.

## What's inside?

- Study notes
- Python scripts
- Logic and data structure exercises
- Simple projects using libraries like:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `tensorflow` (just the basics)
- Basic AI model experiments

## Goal

📌 My goal with this repo is to improve my programming skills and gradually understand how AI models work from scratch.

## Status

🚧 Still learning — expect changes, experiments, and messy code. This repo will keep growing as I go.

Thanks for stopping by 🙌
