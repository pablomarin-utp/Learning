# Learning Python and Artificial Intelligence 🧠🐍

This repository is where I practice and learn basic concepts of **Python** and **Artificial Intelligence**. I'm uploading small projects, exercises, and experiments as I study and explore.

## What's inside?

- Study notes
- Python scripts
- Logic and data structure exercises
- Simple projects using libraries like:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `tensorflow` (very basic)
- Basic AI model experiments

## Goal

📌 My goal with this repo is to improve my programming skills and gradually understand how AI models work.

## Status

🚧 Constantly learning. This repo will keep growing as I learn more.
